# JavaScript Events
Due 7/15/2016 for Adv Web 2 in Summer 2016

## Resources

* [Image 1](http://digitalsynopsis.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/minimal-web-color-palettes-combination-hex-code-1.png) Used this for inspiration for my "form" color scheme.

* [Image 2](http://digitalsynopsis.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/minimal-web-color-palettes-combination-hex-code-3.png) Used this as inspiration for my "custom" branch scheme.

* [Contact Form](http://tangledindesign.com/how-to-create-a-contact-form-using-html5-css3-and-php/) Used this as a refresher for creating a contact page.

* [Onsubmit event by W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onsubmit.asp) Helped me understand how to make the event listener go off when clicking "submit" button.

* [Form elements collection by W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/coll_form_elements.asp) Helped me understand what I was doing wrong in my form event listener! I forgot to add ".value" so my JavaScript kept returning "undefined" or "HTML input type".

* [Gif-finder](http://gif-finder.com/aubrey-plaza-annoyed-no/) Used the Aubrey gif from this site.

Super scary homework at first... but I think I kind of got the hang of it.
