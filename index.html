        <h1>Big Brother 18</h1>
        <h2>A rant about this week's POV episode</h2>

        <p>Below are some random thoughts I had during the most recent episode (7/13/2016) of <em>Big Brother 18</em>, by me, Alley Manalio.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Bridgette is a complete idiot.</li>
            <li>Frank is playing Bridgette like a fiddle.</li>
            <li>Paul and his beard are starting to grow on me.</li>
            <li>I really love James/Natalie.</li>
            <li>Can we please get Tiffany out this week?</li>
            <li>Bridgette is still a complete idiot.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Okay, phew. I feel better getting all that off my chest.</p>
